In the presented work, the features of mechanical stiffness of carbon nanoparticles (nanodiamonds and fullerenes) in a wide range of sizes are considered. The enhancement of nanodiamonds stiffness (comparing to bulk diamond) is studied and explained in the terms of average bond stiffness $k_0$. It is shown that $k_0$ can be useful in the description of various carbon nanostructures and gives reliable estimates of their incompressibility. Moreover, we found that $k_0$ can be well estimated based only on relaxed atomic geometry.
