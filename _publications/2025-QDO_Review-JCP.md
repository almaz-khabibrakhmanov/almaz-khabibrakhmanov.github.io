#excerpt: 'The DFT study of graphene oxide (GO) patterned by pristine graphene nanoroads, where I explored how various GO compositions and nanoroads width and orientations affect electronic properties of this nanostructured material. Similar to fluorinated graphene, the band gap exhibits oscillatory decrease with broadening nanoroads. The emerging edge magnetism suggests possible applications of patterned GO in optoelectronics and spintronics.'

<b>Abstract:</b> Accurately modeling polarization and van der Waals (vdW) interactions in atomistic systems typically requires high-level quantum-mechanical methods that are computationally expensive, hence limited in applicability. To address this challenge, efficient yet physically grounded models are needed—ones that not only enable accurate predictions but also provide insight into how noncovalent interactions scale in complex molecular and material systems. This review highlights the quantum Drude oscillator (QDO) model, a physically motivated and computationally efficient framework that captures the essential features of electronic response, including polarization and dispersion forces, across a wide range of chemical and material systems. We discuss how the QDO model quantitatively reproduces the polarization response of many-electron atoms and how key components of noncovalent interactions—exchange-repulsion, polarization, and dispersion—emerge naturally in QDO dimers. Furthermore, the model provides predictive scaling laws that elucidate trends in polarizability and dispersion across the periodic table and in molecular assemblies. By uniting interpretability, accuracy, and efficiency, the QDO model offers a versatile approach for modeling noncovalent interactions in systems ranging from isolated molecules to complex condensed phases and nanostructured materials.
