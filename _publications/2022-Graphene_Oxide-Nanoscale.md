excerpt: 'The DFT study of graphene oxide (GO) patterned by pristine graphene nanoroads, where I explored how various GO compositions and nanoroads width and orientations affect electronic properties of this nanostructured material. Similar to fluorinated graphene, the band gap exhibits oscillatory decrease with broadening nanoroads. The emerging edge magnetism suggests possible applications of patterned GO in optoelectronics and spintronics.'

<b>Abstract:</b> In this work, we suggest an approach to manipulate the electronic properties of graphene oxide in a controllable manner. We study graphene nanoroads paved inside graphene oxide using density functional calculations. We show that this patterning allows transforming an insulator, graphene oxide, into a semiconductor or metal depending on the orientation of the nanoroads and their magnetic state. As a semiconductor, patterned graphene oxide is characterized by notably low effective masses of charge carriers. Additionally, we demonstrate the possibility to force the transition from a semiconducting to a half-metallic state in a controllable manner, by application of an external electric field. We believe that this remarkable opportunity to combine and control the electronic and magnetic properties of a material within a single sheet of graphene oxide paves the way towards new applications of graphene-oxide-based devices in 2D optoelectronics and spintronics.
