excerpt: 'Building upon my previous work, I studied mechanical stiffness of nanodiamonds in detail via DFT simulations. The main outcome is that nanodiamonds can exhibit stiffness superior to bulk diamond depending on their shape and size. Furthermore, we formulated an unambigous way to characterize the incompressibility of finite nanoobjects through <i>average bond stiffness</i>. Unlike conventional elastic moduli, this quantity does not depend on volume, which is ill-defined at nanoscale.'

In the presented work, the features of mechanical stiffness of carbon nanoparticles (nanodiamonds and fullerenes) in a wide range of sizes are considered. The enhancement of nanodiamonds stiffness (comparing to bulk diamond) is studied and explained in the terms of average bond stiffness $$k_0$$. It is shown that $$k_0$$ can be useful in the description of various carbon nanostructures and gives reliable estimates of their incompressibility. Moreover, we found that $$k_0$$ can be well estimated based only on relaxed atomic geometry.
