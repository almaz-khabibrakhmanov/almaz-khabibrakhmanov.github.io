In Fall 2021, I was teaching [Computational Methods course](https://almaz-khabibrakhmanov.github.io/files/teaching/CompMethods/Computational_Methods_AY_21_22.pdf) for M.Sc. in Physics (together with Dr. Mario Galante and advised by Prof. Alexandre Tkatchenko). For this course, I was preparing lectures, hands-on tutorials, homework exercises and exam projects. While being challenging at first, I enjoyed the experience of sharing my knowledge with students and diligently preparing for it. The invested effort paid back as a positive and encouraging feedback from our students at the end of the semester.

Below you can find my part of lecture slides and hands-on sessions, as well as the exam projects that we created for this course.
