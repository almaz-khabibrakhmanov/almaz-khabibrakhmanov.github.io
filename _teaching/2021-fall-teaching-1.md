In Fall 2021, I was teaching Computational Methods course for M.Sc. in Physics (together with Dr. Mario Galante). For this course, I was preparing lectures, hands-on tutorials, homework exercises and exam projects. While challenging at first, I enjoyed the experience of sharing my knowledge with students and diligently preparing for it. Below ypu can find lecture slides (my part of them), as well as the homeworks and exam projects we created for this course.
