In Spring 2023, I was a teaching assistant for the Quantum Mechanics course for 2nd year Bachelors in Physics. The lectures were given by Dr. Dmitry Fedorov and Dr. Loris Di Cairano (under the guidance of Prof. Alexandre Tkatchenko). On my weekly seminars, I was explaining solutions to typical quantum-mechanical problems and introducing students to important practical aspects of quantum mechanics. The seminars were presented in a blackboard style, which was a much enjoyable and inspiring experience for me. During classes, I was refreshing minimal required theory and connecting to lectures, which was followed by solving some examples. I practiced inviting students to a blackboard and guiding their solution process to keep classes interactive and correct typical mistakes on the fly.

I was also preparing homework tasks for each seminar, which you can find below.
