    <p>I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Theoretical Chemical Physics](https://tcpunilu.com) group specializing in physics-driven computational approaches to (bio)molecular and materials modeling. My work focuses on accurately and efficiently describing noncovalent interactions, bridging quantum theory and practical molecular simulations.</p>
    <p>During my PhD, I developed advanced computational methods, such as the universal van der Waals (vdW) interatomic potentials or many-body dispersion (MBD), to capture subtle many-body vdW interactions and the induced charge polarization effects in complex molecular systems. I am passionate about turning cutting-edge theoretical concepts into robust computational tools that can drive insights in chemistry, biology, and materials science.</p>
    <p>My expertise spans noncovalent interactions (especially vdW dispersion), interatomic potentials, chemical physics, and materials modeling. I have a decent hands-on experience with density functional theory (FHI-aims, VASP), quantum chemistry (PySCF, Q-Chem, ORCA), and molecular dynamics (LAMMPS) packages.</p>
    <p>I thrive at the intersection of fundamental science and computational innovation, creating models that are both physically rigorous and scalable for real-world research applications. I enjoy collaborating across disciplines and translating sophisticated quantum mechanics concepts into interpretable results. I also take pleasure in communicating science in clear, simple terms, gaining new insights through this process.</p>
    <p>Outside of research, I am a passionate guitarist and a football player. I also enjoy running, hiking, and reading. If you're into heavy music, we might find even more common ground to talk about.</p>
