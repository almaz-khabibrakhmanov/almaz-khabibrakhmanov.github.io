I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Theoretical Chemical Physics](https://tcpunilu.com) group specializing in physics-driven computational approaches to (bio)molecular and materials modeling. My work focuses on accurately and efficiently describing noncovalent interactions, bridging quantum theory and practical molecular simulations.

During my PhD, I developed advanced computational methods, such as the universal van der Waals (vdW) interatomic potentials or many-body dispersion (MBD), to capture subtle many-body vdW interactions and the induced charge polarization effects in complex molecular systems. I am passionate about turning cutting-edge theoretical concepts into robust computational tools that can drive insights in chemistry, biology, and materials science.

My expertise spans noncovalent interactions (especially vdW dispersion), interatomic potentials, chemical physics, and materials modeling. I have a decent hands-on experience with density functional theory (FHI-aims, VASP), quantum chemistry (PySCF, Q-Chem, ORCA), and molecular dynamics (LAMMPS) packages.

I thrive at the intersection of fundamental science and computational innovation, creating models that are both physically rigorous and scalable for real-world research applications. I enjoy collaborating across disciplines and translating sophisticated quantum mechanics concepts into interpretable results. I also take pleasure in communicating science in clear, simple terms, gaining new insights through this process.

Outside of research, I am a passionate guitarist and a football player. I also enjoy running, hiking, and reading. If you're into heavy music, we might find even more common ground to talk about.
